# Introduction
A car's performance is usually measured using an acceleration test with a 1KM distance. Some cars are measured from a cold start (they start at 0KM/H), some are tested from a hot start (the car is running at a stable speed and then accelerates).
 
Factors that are needed to compute acceleration (m/s ):
1. Initial Velocity (V ) - starting speed.
2. Final Velocity (V ) - final speed at the target distance (1KM).
3. Time (T) - the total time consumed to reach 1KM.
 
The formula for acceleration is:
    
    Acceleration = (Vf - Vi) / T


# Compilation

     >nasm -f win64 asmAcceleration.asm

     >gcc -c acceleration.c -o acceleration.obj -m64

     >gcc acceleration.obj asmAcceleration.obj -o c.exe -m64

     >c.exe

## Test Cases 
Given sample input :
3
0.0, 62.5, 10.1
60.0, 122.3, 5.5
30.0, 160.7, 7.8

### Input:
Enter number of cars to generate: 3  
Do you want to generate the inputs randomly (Y/N): N
```
0.0, 62.5, 10.1
60.0, 122.3, 5.5
30.0, 160.7, 7.8
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
3
5
```

### Input:
Enter number of cars to generate: 10   
Do you want to generate the inputs randomly (Y/N): Y
